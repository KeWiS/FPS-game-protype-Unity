# FPS-game-protype-Unity
My prototype of simple FPS game, made using Unity Engine

Key features:
- 2 main gunes - pistol and sniper rifle
- sniper rifle can use scope
- different crosshairs for each weapon
- fire rate, so player can't spam shooting
- 3 targets for sniper only, 2 for pistol only
- Simple shooting sounds and music
- jumping
- crouching
- simple main menu
- You win! screen with buttons
- reset button after finishing game
- main menu button after finishing game
- score count i left upper corner
- random spawns of shooting targets, each load of game scene - new positions of boxes

Used free unity assets from asset store, scripts entirely written by me

Created on Unity 2017.4.40f1
